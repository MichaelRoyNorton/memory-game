# Memory Game Project

##Introduction

A Memory Game project completed for my course with Udacity

## How to play the game

Flip the card by clicking it. If 2 flipped cards are the same they will remain open. Match all cards to win the game. Try and do it in as few moves and as short a time as possible.
