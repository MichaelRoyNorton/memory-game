# Memory Game Project

## Introduction

A Memory Game project completed for my course with Udacity

## How to play the game

Flip the card by clicking it. If 2 flipped cards are the same they will remain open and turn green. Incorrect guesses turn red and shake. Match all cards to win the game. Try and do it in as few moves and as short a time as possible.
